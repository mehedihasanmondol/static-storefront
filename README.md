### Deploy to Static Hosting

After building, your `dist/` folder will contain:

└── vite.svg           # Favicon
```

### Hosting Platforms

#### GitHub Pages
1. Push your `dist/` folder contents to your repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Your store will be available at `username.github.io/repository-name`

#### Netlify

2. Access via any IPFS gateway
3. Perfect for censorship-resistant hosting

#### Other Platforms
